# Object Oriented Programming (DIEF, UNIMORE)
This is an intermediate programming course about the Object Oriented methodology and Java. We recommend this course to learners who have previous experience in software development or a background in computer science.  At the end of this course, learners will be empowered to create a real-world Java program. In achieving this goal, students will learn the fundamentals of Object Oriented Programming, how to leverage the power of existing libraries, how to build graphical user interfaces, how to use some core algorithms for searching and sorting data and how to read and write data both locally and from the network.

## Exam
The final exam is a discussion about both the home project and theoretical aspects concerning Java and OOP techniques. It is worth noticing that the project is not supposed to be developed alone without supervision, but mostly during the course. The whole development process and related discussions with Prof. Bicocchi will be evaluated. Students are expected:

* to pass an oral examination about OOP techniques and the Java language (short written exercises might be used, see topics above) 

* to successfully discuss about the structure, the internals and engineering choices of their home project

## FAQ
Can we develop the project in groups of 1 or 3 people?
> No, groups must be composed of two 2 people. There are no exceptions. The use of git for developing and sharing code is strongly advised. People unable to find a teammate should write to me.

Which kind of project can we do?
> You can code a video game, a mobile app, a managing software. Concerning video games, Unity is allowed but the project must contain a significant portion of object oriented code. 

How big the project has to be?
> A project comprised of 1000-3000 source lines of code is enough to grasp the feeling of what developing software means.

What is the best moment for starting the project?
> The first half of the course concerns basic topics that must be assimilated before starting. My personal suggestion is to start the project around midterm and use the second part of the course to sketch out the main design.

While developing I get strange errors. What should I do?
> The first thing to do is copy and paste the error string on Google and check for eventual answers on StackOverflow. The vast majority of common errors has a dedicated page.

If I need help, should I write an email to book an appointment?
> No! You can directly come to my office during receiving hours. Wednesday 10 - 13, building 27, I floor.

How does the exam is evaluated?
> The final grade is the arithmetic average between the home project and the oral examination on Java and OOP techniques. For avoiding delusions, please study the theoretical part as well as having fun with the project!
